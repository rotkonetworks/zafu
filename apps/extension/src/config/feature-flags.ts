/**
 * NU6.3 orchard -> ironwood turnstile migration.
 *
 * When ON, the zcash home screen shows a "migrate to ironwood" banner
 * (Zashi proposeShielding-style prompt) whenever the wallet holds orchard
 * balance, and exposes the turnstile migration flow (orchard spends ->
 * ironwood output in a single V6 transaction, cold-signed via the existing
 * PCZT QR machine).
 *
 * Shipped ON (guard-protected): the ironwood wasm exports are in the deployed
 * blob and the flow is fully reviewed. Before NU6.3 activates, the migration
 * is fail-closed at build time - the worker fetches consensus_branch_id from
 * GetLightdInfo and the producer REFUSES to build unless the bound branch id
 * equals the real NU6.3 value (0x37a5165b), so the migrate action shows a
 * clean "NU6.3 not active yet" error rather than producing an invalid tx.
 * This avoids a second store cycle to enable migration at activation.
